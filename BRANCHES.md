# Project Branches

## Releases

### release/0.2

Removed compare_versions function; other packages do this more completely and this function would likely be confusing.

Moved JSON functions to sculpt-json-tools.

### release/0.1.1

Because the README claims something that isn't true.

### release/0.1

First public release.
