# Project Branches

## Releases

### release/1.0

Stable enough to make it a 1.0 release so it can easily be installed via PyPI.

### release/0.2

Removed compare_versions function; other packages do this more completely and this function would likely be confusing.

Moved JSON functions to sculpt-json-tools.

### release/0.1.1

Because the README claims something that isn't true.

### release/0.1

First public release.

## Features

### feature/add-docs

Time to write some documentation!
